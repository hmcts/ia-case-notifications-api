            This vulnerability is about potential Remote Code Execution when serializing and deserializing Java classes
            using HttpInvokerServiceExport and org.springframework.remoting.
            As we don't use those constructs, we are not affected by it.
            The suppression will be a long-term one. An expiry to the suppression is kept to allow re-evaluating whether
            we're still unaffected by it.
