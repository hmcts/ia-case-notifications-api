             https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1000027
             Root Cause: spring-web-5.2.3.RELEASE.jar <= org/springframework/remoting/httpinvoker/HttpInvokerServiceExporter.class : [2.5.1,)
             Pivotal Spring Framework 4.1.4 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required
             Note: No java deserialization of untrusted data is happening in this component therefore it is suppressed.

            False positive - https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/5502

            We don't use the libraries affected by this vulnerability. This is a false positive in dependencycheck that is still current in version 8.2.1.
            Try to remove it when a dependencycheck upgrade becomes available.
            If it still happens, check that we don't use hutool-json and json-java. If we do not, extend the suppression date by another year.
